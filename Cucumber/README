Cucumber is a Ruby-based BDD tool that supports expressing tests in natural language in the format Given/When/Then. These natural language statements are connected to code that automates the tests in the step files (see the step_definitions directory for examples).

You can find additional information about Cucumber at http://cukes.info/

This example was created by Elisabeth Hendrickson.

Note that these tests use the support library, triangle_test_lib.rb, that's included as part of the RSpec tests in the RSpec directory.

To run these tests:
1. make sure you have Ruby installed.
2. install Cucumber (if you haven't already): gem install cucumber
3. cd to the Cucumber directory
4. execute the command: cucumber triangle.feature
