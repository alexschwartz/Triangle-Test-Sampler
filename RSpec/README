RSpec is a BDD tool that allows you to express tests in Ruby in a readable and natural way. For information on RSpec, see http://rspec.info/

This example was created by Elisabeth Hendrickson

To execute these tests:

1. make sure you have Ruby installed
2. install RSpec if you haven't already: gem install rspec
3. cd to the RSpec directory in this project
4. execute the following command: spec triangle_spec.rb
