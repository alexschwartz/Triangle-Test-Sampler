These tests cover the most basic expectations of the triangle engine. There are, of course, other interesting tests for triangle: invalid inputs, decimal values, negative values, very large values, and various other configurations of invalid triangles & valid triangle with different angles. 

There are also potentially interesting tests one could run to characterize the behavior of the app as a whole: varying timing to see its affect on history, assessing behavior with numerous simultaneous sessions, etc. However, additional tests are left as an exercise for the reader.
